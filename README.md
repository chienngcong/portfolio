### üìä Project
1. Traffic Volume Analysis on I-94 Interstate ‚Äì Key Insights. [Project 1: I 94 Interstate traffic jam](https://www.kaggle.com/code/chienngcong/heavy-traffic-indicators-on-i-94)

In this project, I analyzed traffic patterns on the I-94 Interstate to identify factors contributing to heavy traffic. The analysis revealed that traffic volume is typically higher during warmer months (March‚ÄìOctober), on business days compared to weekends, and during peak hours around 7 AM and 4 PM. Certain weather conditions such as shower snow, light rain and snow, and proximity thunderstorms with drizzle were also associated with increased traffic congestion.

2. Analysis of EUR/USD Trends Through Three U.S. Presidential Terms. [Project 2: Change of rate EUR/USD](https://www.kaggle.com/code/chienngcong/analysis-of-eur-usd-trends-through-three-u-s-pres)

In this project, I analyzed the 30-day moving average (Mean(30)) of the EUR/USD exchange rate across three U.S. presidential terms (Bush, Obama, Trump) to identify long-term currency trends. The analysis showed a sharp euro appreciation during the Bush era, a strong dollar recovery under Obama, and relative stability during Trump‚Äôs term. This project highlights how macroeconomic and political cycles influence currency strength over time.

3.  Cyclistic How to tranform the casual riders to manual riders . [Project 3: Cyclistic - case study in GDAPC](https://www.kaggle.com/code/chienngcong/cyclistic-gdapc)

As part of the Google Data Analytics Capstone, I analyzed user behavior for Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago with over 5,800 bikes and 692 docking stations. The main objective was to investigate the behavioral differences between annual members and casual riders using historical trip data. By processing and visualizing usage patterns‚Äîincluding ride duration, start/end times, bike types, and rider types‚ÄîI generated actionable insights for the marketing team.

The goal was to support a data-driven strategy to convert more casual riders into annual members, increasing long-term revenue. I cleaned and explored data using R (tidyverse, dplyr, ggplot2), identified key trends, and helped shape marketing recommendations based on ride behavior. The analysis was presented to Cyclistic‚Äôs marketing director and key stakeholders to guide future promotional campaigns.

4. Cyclistic User Behavior Dashboard
Tools: BigQuery, SQL, Tableau, Excel | Project Type: BI & ETL Capstone

As part of the Google Business Intelligence Capstone Project, I developed a full BI solution for Cyclistic, a New York-based bike-sharing company. The goal was to analyze user behavior across over 5 million trips to support data-driven station expansion planning.

I designed and executed the ETL process: writing SQL to extract and transform data in BigQuery, then visualized key insights in Tableau through dynamic dashboards. The project included defining stakeholder requirements, mapping user needs, documenting KPIs, and producing executive-ready visuals with filtering by location, season, and user type.

This project demonstrates my capability in stakeholder-focused BI development, structured analytics documentation, and data storytelling using cloud-based tools.
